# Modules, Packages, Libraries, & Frameworks

This page gives a quick overview of four foundational concepts in Python: modules, packages, libraries, and frameworks.

---

## Modules

**Module** = a single Python file (.py) with code, like functions or classes, that you can import into other files. Think of it as a small toolkit for specific tasks.

**Example**: A `math_tools.py` file with functions for addition and subtraction. You import it and use its functions directly.

---

## Packages

**Package** = a __<u>folder</u>__ containing multiple related modules and an `__init__.py` file. Packages help organize code for bigger projects by grouping related files together under one directory.

**Example**: A `calculator` folder with files for `addition.py` and `subtraction.py`. You import the whole package and access its functions.

---

## Libraries

**Library** = a collection of packages and modules focused on a broader purpose, like data manipulation. Libraries offer ready-made tools you can pull in as needed, without needing a specific structure.

**Example**: The `pandas` library, used for data analysis. You import parts of it for specific tasks but donâ€™t have to follow strict patterns or rules.

---

## Frameworks

**Framework** = a structured environment that provides everything needed to build an application, guiding the layout and design. Unlike libraries, frameworks set the structure and rules for your project.

**Example**: Django, a web framework for Python. It defines how files are organized, how routes work, and has built-in tools to help you build a website.

### Quick Recap

- **Module**: One .py file with reusable code.
- **Package**: A folder of related modules.
- **Library**: A collection of packages and modules for a broad purpose; used flexibly.
- **Framework**: A full structure for building applications, with specific rules to follow.
